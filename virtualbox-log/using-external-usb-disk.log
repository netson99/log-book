Purpose: 
- using usb external disk as disk storage in virtualbox
- to bypass restriction on some OS that can not install the OS on the external disk (ie Windows OS)
- install linux distro on usb disk as recovery disk.


Note:
- I test this on my linux pc.
- assume the external disk is /dev/sdc

Preparation:
1. Create raw disk image of the external disk.
	- as root run command :
	    VBoxManange internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /VBoxImg/disk-sdc.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdc

2. Use this /VBoxImg/disk-sdc.vmdk as storage on Virtualbox
    - on the storage selection, choose "choose existing disk" and select the raw disk that we have prepared on step 1.

3. Virtualbox have to be run as root / use root privileges
